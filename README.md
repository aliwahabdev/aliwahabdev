## Hello there! :)

I'm Ali, a Lebanese programmer who lives in Germany. 

My passion for programming developed when I was between the ages of 10 and 15, and it has only grown stronger since then.

#### Here are some details about me that may help you get to know me better:
- At the moment, I'm working on several projects that are either my own ideas or those of a friend.
- I'm currently learning programming languages such as Rust, C/C++, and JS/TS.
- I'm interested in collaborating on new projects.

#### If you have any questions or need assistance with anything, feel free to ask me! You can also reach me through my contact information.
